Step 1:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter, to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; put to the side.

Step 2:
In another bowl, whisk the milk, butter, and the egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until moistened (a few lumps are ok).

Step 3:
Heat a large skillet (nonstick/cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, moisten with oil; then, carefully rub skillet with the oiled paper towel.

Step 4:
For each pancake, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, use the back of the spoon to spread the batter in a round shape (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 pancakes in a large skillet).

Step 5:
Cook until surface of pancakes have a few bubbles, which is about 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a spatula, and cook until the underside is a bit brown, after another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover a little loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with whats left of the oil and the batter. (You should have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with any toppings.
